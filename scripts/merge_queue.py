"""Merge queue for develop branches that have no server-side merge queue.

GitHub's native merge queue is configured *through* branch protection, so it is
unavailable to any private repository on a Free plan. That is the situation in
``digithings-ai/twelve-x`` and in every other private repo we own; the survey and
the evidence are in ``docs/MERGE_QUEUE.md``. This script is the queue for those
branches: it reads the open PRs targeting a base, evaluates each against the
gates the absent server-side rules would have enforced, and merges the eligible
ones one at a time in creation order, re-reading the queue after every merge.

Because a base branch that requires up-to-date checks means every merge pushes every
other PR behind its base — and a PR behind its base is refused, not fixed, by merging
it — ``run`` also brings one stale branch up to date per tick. That step is the
difference between a queue that drains and one that needs an operator to clear a path
after every single merge.

Two things this deliberately does not do, because reading a green run as if it
proved more than it does is how a queue gets mistaken for a fence:

* It does not enforce anything. Without branch protection on the branch, nothing
  stops ``git push origin develop``. The gates below run only because somebody on
  the merge-authority roster invoked this script. It is a merge *path*, and it
  genuinely removes the per-merge decision card — but it is not a merge *fence*.
* It never passes ``--admin``. When a PR fails a gate, the queue reports the
  reason and stops. An operator can always escalate by hand; a queue that
  escalates for you would be indistinguishable from a queue that ignores the
  gates.

Every merge posts an audit comment naming the acting role and the verdicts it
relied on. That comment is the evidence that no decision card was needed. If a
merge ever does need one, the trail shows which role claimed the merge was
already covered.

Usage::

    python3 scripts/merge_queue.py list --repo digithings-ai/twelve-x --acting-role cto
    python3 scripts/merge_queue.py run  --repo digithings-ai/twelve-x --acting-role em --dry-run
    python3 scripts/merge_queue.py run  --repo digithings-ai/twelve-x --acting-role em

    refuses, and refusing is right. What was missing is what comes next. Every merge
    this script performs moves the base for every other PR, so with no update step the

    nothing in it can clear. Measured on `digithings` on 2026-10-19: fourteen
    hand-run `gh pr update-branch` calls moved a single PR, and the queue reported
    `0 eligible` again the moment that merge landed.

    Updating is safe where merging is not. It writes a merge of the base *into* the
    branch, so it loses no work and cannot land a change that was not reviewed; it
    re-triggers the checks. The `expected_head_sha` is still pinned, exactly as
    `merge_one` pins `--match-head-commit`: an update is only ever applied to the head
    the gates were read from, so a push landing in between is reported rather than
    silently merged under. The PR is re-evaluated on a later tick, never merged on the
